# Small CSS animations series - 01

In these series of exercises you have to replicate a series of elements.

Make an exact copy of the examples and write your own HTML and CSS!

## Before you start

Please copy and paste this code inside your editor:

```html

<html>
    <head>
    <meta  charset="utf-8"  />
        <style>
        /* Put your styling here */
    </style>
    </head>
<body>

<!-- put your content here -->

</body>

</html>
```
