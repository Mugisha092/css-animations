# Small CSS animations series - 06

In these series of exercises you have to replicate a series of elements.

Make an exact copy of the examples and write your own HTML and CSS!

## SPECIAL

This exercise is a little different than the others, Try to make  a little page and style it to your taste. Include this text somewhere on the page (be creative!).

` Lonely commute`

`Join Australia-based photographer Mark Forbes as he wanders the streets of Tokyo with a camera & heart full of curiosity documenting the Lonely Commute.`

Now imagine a small gallery of images where you can hover over and get the animated result at the bottom for each of them.

## Before you start

Please copy and paste this code inside your editor:

```html
<html>
     <head>
     <meta charset="utf-8" />
         <style>
         /* Put your styling here */
         </style>
 </head>
<body>

<!-- put your content here -->

</body>

</html>
```
